            <h1>About Naawi-Oodena</h1>
            <p>Naawi-Oodena, which translates to "centre of the heart and community" in Anishinaabemowin, is a transformative urban reserve located in southwest Winnipeg. The 160-acre site sits on the former Kapyong Barracks lands, which were vacated by the Canadian Armed Forces in 2004. After a long legal battle and years of negotiations, the land was officially returned to the seven Treaty One First Nations in 2022. These First Nations include Brokenhead Ojibway Nation, Long Plain First Nation, Peguis First Nation, Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation, Sagkeeng First Nation, Sandy Bay Ojibway First Nation, and Swan Lake First Nation.

The development of Naawi-Oodena is being spearheaded by the Treaty One Development Corporation in partnership with the Canada Lands Company. The vision is to create a vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable urban community that celebrates Indigenous culture while integrating into the broader Winnipeg landscape. Plans for Naawi-Oodena include mixed-use residential and commercial development, as well as recreational and cultural facilities, making it one of the most ambitious Indigenous-led urban developments in Canada. This initiative is not only a symbol of land reclamation but also of Indigenous economic resurgence and self-determination.</p>
